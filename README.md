This project explores how Netflix’s content has changed over time, focusing on the mix between movies and TV shows, popular genres, and contributions from different countries. The goal is to uncover patterns in viewer preferences and content distribution, which can help Netflix make smarter decisions about what to produce, acquire, and promote. These insights are especially useful as Netflix faces growing competition from platforms like Amazon Prime, Disney+, and regional OTT providers.

The main users of this analysis include Netflix’s strategy teams, who use the data to decide what types of content to invest in and which regions to expand into. Content planning and production teams benefit by understanding what viewers enjoy, helping them create or license shows and movies that match current trends. Data analysts and business intelligence teams use the findings to build dashboards and reports that guide decision-making. Marketing and regional expansion teams apply the insights to tailor campaigns for different countries and promote content that resonates locally. Researchers and students also use the dataset to learn how data analytics works in the entertainment industry, practicing skills like visualization and storytelling with real-world data.

The project is built using Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language ideal for data analysis. Several Python libraries are used to handle different tasks: Pandas for cleaning and analyzing data, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating charts and graphs, and Datetime for working with release dates. Plotly may also be used for interactive visualizations if needed.

All analysis is done in Jupyter Notebook, which allows users to write code, display charts, and explain their work in one place. The dataset used is a CSV file containing around 7,789 records and 11 columns, with details such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and content type. Optional tools and platforms include Google Colab or Anaconda for running notebooks online or offline, GitHub for sharing the project, and Excel or Google Sheets for quick data checks or presentations.
